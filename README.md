# CSS Specificity and !important: Unexpected Inheritance Behavior

This repository demonstrates an unusual edge case in CSS involving specificity, inheritance, and the `!important` flag.  The issue arises from an unexpected interaction of how these concepts work together.

The `bug.css` file contains a CSS snippet that produces the unexpected result.  The `bugSolution.css` file provides a solution, and explanation of why the problem occurs.

The core problem lies in the interplay of specificity, inheritance, and the `!important` flag in CSS. Although `!important` usually wins, in this specific scenario, it seems that inheritance from a more specific selector wins over `!important` in an unusual way. The solution involves understanding and adjusting the specificity in a way that ensures the desired outcome.
